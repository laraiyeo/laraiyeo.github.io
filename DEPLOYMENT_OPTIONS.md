## 🚀 **Recommended Deployment Path**

### **For Development/Testing:**
```bash
# Use Railway (Free)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect Railway to your repo  
3. Add Redis database
4. Deploy automatically
```

### **For Production:**
```bash
# Use DigitalOcean ($6/month)
1. Create droplet
2. Use provided Docker setup
3. Point domain to droplet
4. Set up SSL certificate
```

## 📱 **Mobile App Configuration**

Once deployed, just update your API URL:

```javascript
// In BackendApiService.js
const API_BASE_URL = __DEV__ 
  ? 'http://localhost:3001/api'           // Local development
  : 'https://your-app.railway.app/api';   // Production (Railway)
  // OR: 'https://your-domain.com/api';   // Production (VPS)
```

## 🎯 **My Recommendation**

**Start with Railway** because:
- ✅ **5-minute setup** - Literally just connect GitHub
- ✅ **Free Redis included** - No separate database setup
- ✅ **Automatic HTTPS** - Secure by default  
- ✅ **Auto-scaling** - Handles traffic spikes
- ✅ **No server maintenance** - They handle everything
- ✅ **Easy updates** - Git push = deploy

Later, if you need more control or hit usage limits, you can easily migrate to a VPS.

## 🔧 **Quick Railway Setup**

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add backend server"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway:**
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - "Deploy from GitHub"
   - Select your repo
   - Add Redis database
   - Deploy!

3. **Update mobile app:**
   ```javascript
   const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-project.railway.app/api';
   ```

**That's it!** Your server will be running 24/7 without your computer needing to be on.
