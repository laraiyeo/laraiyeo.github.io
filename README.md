## #Ô∏è‚É£ Current known issues

- On the scoreboard page, if the user is on a phone screen and they turn it landscape, it will show the regular phone view (max 3 innings) in landscape until the next fetch. Vice versa for landscape to portrait.
- For NHL scoreboard, at times it may show undefined for play-by-play. This is an issue from the api directly as it doesn't update some things immediately.
- For Soccer, UEFA, and CWC, the top scoreboard score and time as well as the play description might not update in real time. This is a problem caused by ESPN's api
- For F1, some race information may experience delays due to ESPN's F1 API update frequency during live race sessions
- Live streaming may occasionally fail to load due to external stream source availability
- F1 OBS overlays may show brief loading states when switching between race cards and constructor standings
- For streaming, you most definitely need a strong pop-up and ad blocker as the stream where the video comes from has an ad script embedded in it (I have made multiple attempts to try and remove it to no avail).
- Last matches for all sports are currently facing issues when you try and search too far back
- For NBA, WNBA, NFL, and NHL, the players headshots on the copied game card are squished a little if you click copy twice. On the first copy, they are normal
- For player game log search, you can go back for as many years the player is active, however, if a player was traded during the season, it only shows game log for the team they were traded to. UEFA searches also don't allow for different leagues (Eg. game log for Harry Kane on March 11, 2021 won't show as Tottenham were in Europa that season)
- Mini Basketball Court Issues for NBA and WNBA play-by-play:
  - Mobile court styling: The basketball court visualization on mobile screens may not display with proper proportions and element positioning
  - Shot marker positioning: Some shot location dots may appear slightly off-center or outside court boundaries for certain play coordinates
  - Coordinate mapping inconsistencies: Occasional misalignment between ESPN's coordinate system and visual court positioning, particularly for corner shots and free throw attempts
  - Mobile landscape orientation: Court elements may not scale properly when switching between portrait and landscape modes on mobile devices
