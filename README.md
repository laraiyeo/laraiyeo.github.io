## #Ô∏è‚É£ Current known issues

- There are some issues with the code, as it is now, some teams might generate 2 or even 3 empty game containers. I'm not sure why and I also don't really know how to fix the issue. For now, if this happens, just click on the teams tab again and it should show the teams properly
- I've also had to change the fetch rate to 2 seconds as it was consuming too much data with a fetch rate of 1 second.
- On the scoreboard page, if the user is on a phone screen and they turn it landscape, it will show the regular phone view (max 3 innings) in landscape until the next fetch. Vice versa for landscape to portrait.
- For NHL scoreboard, at times it may show undefined for play-by-play. This is an issue from the api directly as it doesn't update some things immediately.
