## #Ô∏è‚É£ Current known issues

- There are some issues with the code, as it is now, some teams might generate 2 or even 3 empty game containers. I'm not sure why and I also don't really know how to fix the issue. For now, if this happens, just click on the teams tab again and it should show the teams properly
- I've also had to change the fetch rate to 2 seconds as it was consuming too much data with a fetch rate of 1 second.
- On the scoreboard page, if the user is on a phone screen and they turn it landscape, it will show the regular phone view (max 3 innings) in landscape until the next fetch. Vice versa for landscape to portrait.
- For NHL scoreboard, at times it may show undefined for play-by-play. This is an issue from the api directly as it doesn't update some things immediately.
- For Soccer, UEFA, and CWC, the top scoreboard score and time as well as the play description might not update in real time. This is a problem caused by ESPN's api
- Bracket page style on mobile is not proper for all sports except UEFA
- NHL search page might not function at times as nhle api has rate limits that blocks requests if done too quickly
- For F1, some race information may experience delays due to ESPN's F1 API update frequency during live race sessions
- Live streaming may occasionally fail to load due to external stream source availability
- F1 OBS overlays may show brief loading states when switching between race cards and constructor standings
- For streaming, you most definitely need a strong pop-up and ad blocker as the stream where the video comes from has an ad script embedded in it (I have made multiple attempts to try and remove it to no avail).
