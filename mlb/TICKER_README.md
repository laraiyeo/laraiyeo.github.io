## Configuration

You can modify the ticker behavior by editing the `TICKER_CONFIG` object in `ticker.js`:

```javascript
const TICKER_CONFIG = {
  width: 1920,           // Ticker width
  height: 200,           // Ticker height
  slideDuration: 5000,   // Time per game (milliseconds)
  refreshInterval: 30000, // Data refresh interval (milliseconds)
  animationDuration: 800  // Animation duration (milliseconds)
};
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No games showing**: Check if there are MLB games scheduled for today
- **Stuck on loading**: Check browser console for API errors
- **Animation issues**: Ensure browser supports CSS animations
- **OBS not displaying**: Make sure the browser source URL is correct and accessible

## Browser Console Commands

For debugging, you can use these commands in the browser console:

- `clearInterval(slideInterval)` - Stop the rotation
- `showNextGame()` - Manually advance to next game
- `fetchGames()` - Manually refresh game data
